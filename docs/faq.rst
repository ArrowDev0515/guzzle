What is this Maximum function nesting error?
============================================

    Maximum function nesting level of '100' reached, aborting

You could run into this error if you have the XDebug extension installed and
you execute a lot of requests in callbacks.  This error message comes
specifically from the XDebug extension. PHP itself does not have a function
nesting limit. Change this setting in your php.ini to increase the limit::

    xdebug.max_nesting_level = 1000

Why am I getting a 417 error response?
======================================

This can occur for a number of reasons, but if you are sending PUT, POST, or
PATCH requests with an ``Expect: 100-Continue`` header, a server that does not
support this header will return a 417 response. You can work around this by
setting the ``expect`` request option to ``false``:

.. code-block:: php

    $client = new GuzzleHttp\Client();

    // Disable the expect header on a single request
    $response = $client->put('/', [], 'the body', [
        'expect' => false
    ]);

    // Disable the expect header on all client requests
    $client->setConfig('defaults/expect', false)
